        <h1>The inside story of Git: Why is Oh Noes so sad?</h1>
        
        <p>We had an exclusive interview with Oh Noes guy, the error buddy, and we asked him the question that all of you were wondering about: "Why do you always seem so sad?" Here's his shocking reply:</p>
        <p id="ohnoes-says"><img src = "https://www.kasandbox.org/programming-images/creatures/OhNoes.png" alt="Oh Noes"></p>
        
        <p>We asked Winston for comment, and this is all he would say about it:</p>
        <p id="winston-says"><img src="https://www.kasandbox.org/programming-images/creatures/Winston.png" alt="Winston"></p>
        <script>
            var ohNoesSays = document.getElementById("ohnoes-says");
            var winstonSays = document.getElementById("winston-says");
            ohNoesSays.innerHTML = "I <strong>don't have a nose</strong> when there is an error in the code!!";
            winstonSays.textContent = "Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha!! "
        </script>
